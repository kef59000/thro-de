
# Setup
## Intalling Docker
Install Docker Desktop on your local machine. Then, run the following code block: 

    docker pull ubuntu
    docker run -it ubuntu bash

## Installing a text editor
Install the text editor **nano** and/or **vim**

    apt update
    apt install nano

    apt-get update
    apt-get install vim

## Determine which Shell you are using:
Type in the following command:

    which $SHELL

Alternatively:
    
    which bash
    
# First steps
Try the following command

    echo "Hi THRO"

# Exercise 1: Creating your first Bash script
Create a file named **my_bash.sh** using the nano command (basically, you can use any editor of your choice , e.g., vim).

## Step 1: Create your script
In your terminal, run the following code:

    nano my_bash.sh

Enter [this code](./bash_01_Ex-01.sh).

Search for your file in the directory:

    ls

Execute your script:

    bash my_bash.sh

## Step 2: Make your script executable
Try the following. What happens?

    ./my_bash.sh

Check for the permissions:

    ls -l

Alter the permission:

    chmod +x my_bash.sh

Check for the permissions again:

    ls -l

Try the following again:

    ./my_bash.sh


# Exercise 2: Variables
Create a bash file with [this code](./bash_02_Ex-02.sh). There are different options to determin the outcome...

# Exercise 3: System Variables, Math
Create a bash file with [this code](./bash_03_Ex-03.sh). 

## Setting system variables
Try the following

    twitter="Elon Musk"
    echo $twitter

Try to use this variable in your script. What happens?

Try the following:

    export twitter

Try to use this variable in your script. What happens now?

## Making your environement variable permanent
Edit the **.bashrc** file (The dot "." indicates that this is a hidden file).

Try the following. Do you see the file?

    ls

Now, try this:

    ls -al

Now, you should see the **.bashrc** file.

Edit the file now:

    nano .bashrc

Add a new line to this file

    twitter="Elon Musk"

Next time you log in to your system, the variable will be set. So, you made it permanent.

# Doing some Bash math
Type in the following code:

    echo $(( 2 + 3 ))
    echo $(( $RANDOM % 10 ))


# Exercise 4: Conditionals
Create a bash file with [this code](./bash_04_Ex-04.sh). 

# Exercise 5: Loops
Create a bash file with [this code](./bash_05_Ex-05.sh).

Note:
- Ctrl + C breaks an infinite loop.
- break breaks the loop
- continue skips the iteration

Maybe you have to install the ping and the curl tool:

    apt install iputils-ping
    apt install curl

Create a file named "cities.txt" and put in these cities, each in a new row: paris, nyc, london
